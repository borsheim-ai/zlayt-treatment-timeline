# REQUIREMENTS — Treatment Timeline prototype (Part 1)

Owner: writer (T-013, revision 3). Source: Appendix A Part 1 (`spec/SPEC.md`), CONTRACT §5 (M1), §5.2, §8.2. Truth values: `spec/SAMPLE_CASE_TRUTHS.md`.
Binding product decisions: `memory/ORCHESTRATOR_DECISIONS.md` (D-001 to D-022); cited below by D-ID. Authority: golden outputs are `evals/golden/` (qa, T-015); the API is `memory/contracts/api.md` and `memory/DECISIONS.md` (architect, T-014). Where this file and either differ, §8 names the open card.
Design it must agree with: `docs/LLM_VS_CODE.md`, `memory/contracts/api.md`, `memory/DECISIONS.md`. ADR-017 in `memory/DECISIONS.md` reconciled the earlier differences (§8); what is still open is listed there.
Every later card and eval cites an R-ID from this file. If a card can't name the R-ID it serves, the card is wrong or this file is.

**User.** A paralegal at a personal-injury firm. She reviews rather than trusts. Every statement the tool makes must be checkable against its source (A-101: she builds the chronology, the attorney signs the letter).

**Two outputs, kept apart (D-001).** The export has two blocks and they never mix:
1. **Treatment section (paste into letter)**: accepted entries and accepted charges. Nothing else. It holds no tool-authored flag content (no flag type, title, reason, day count or count line). The records' own words can appear in it, but only inside an accepted excerpt (D-012), and block 2 tells the attorney which quotes carry flagged language.
2. **Internal review notes — do not send**: accepted flags, flagged language quoted in the letter, amounts not totaled, damages mentions, future treatment recommended, bills to request, records left out, edits, pending items, and a one-line AI-assistance statement (D-009).

**Checkers.**

| Checker | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **UT** | unit test under `tests/unit` (code only, no LLM) |
| **EV** | metric from `python -m evals.run` (golden set in `evals/golden/`, writes `evals/reports/latest.json`) |
| **E2E** | Playwright test under `tests/e2e` |
| **PR** | persona review file `reviews/<card>-<persona>.md`; pass = no blocker or major on that item |
| **INST** | `tools/install_test.sh` clean-clone timed run |

Pass/fail wording is literal. "Pass" means the stated condition holds on every golden case unless one is named.

**Vocabulary (D-013).** Flag types: `gap`, `conflict`, `pre_existing`, `causation`, plus `record_warning` (date ambiguity, injection suspicion). Lexicon types `causation_weakening` and `compliance` map to `causation`. States: `verified`, `needs_review`, `rejected`. Review statuses: `pending`, `accepted`, `edited`, `dismissed`.

## 1. Must-haves

### 1.1 Input

| ID | Requirement | Pass / fail test | Checker |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-IN-1 | Accept records pasted as text. | Pasting the 9 sample records produces 9 timeline entries and the UI shows "9 records found" before any model call. Fail if the count is wrong or not shown. | E2E + UT (splitter; pieces concatenated equal the input) |
| R-IN-2 | Accept records uploaded as a `.txt` file. No PDF or OCR (non-goal 1). | Uploading `evals/golden/sample.txt` gives the same 9 entries as paste. A `.pdf` upload is refused with a plain message, not a crash. | E2E |
| R-IN-3 | Date parsing is code, from an explicit format list. A numeric date is **ambiguous** when its first two numbers are both 1–12 and differ (`04/05/2026`: April 5 or May 4). It is never guessed, and no per-packet convention is inferred (non-goal 18). | Golden `case_01_date_formats`: seven formats parse (ISO, `02/17/2026`, `Feb 24, 2026`, `3 March 2026`, `March 10th, 2026`, `03-17-26`, `3/25/26`); `04/05/2026` is `date_ambiguous` with date null and `date_candidates` 2026-04-05 and 2026-05-04. Fail on any silent guess. | UT + EV (`case_01`) |
| R-IN-4 | Input size is bounded; empty or oversize input fails visibly without calling the LLM. | Empty input and input over `limits.max_chars` each show an error state; the LLM call counter stays 0. | E2E + UT |
| R-IN-5 | **Dates to confirm.** An entry with an ambiguous date is excluded from ordering and gap math, shown in a "Dates to confirm" group placed after the timeline (a `record_warning`), and is `needs_review`. She resolves it with the `confirm_date` action (R-RV-2), choosing one of the code-proposed readings. An undated entry sits in the same group with "no date found"; this build offers no way to type one in. | `case_01` record 8: absent from the timeline order until confirmed; after `confirm_date` 2026-05-04 it sorts into the timeline after 03-25. The gap table is unchanged because record 8 is a phone note (D-003 counts clinical encounters only). With no readings (no date found) an entry can't be confirmed and stays excluded. | UT + E2E |

### 1.2 Timeline

An **entry** is one timeline row: date, provider, one-line summary, exact source excerpt.

| ID | Requirement | Pass / fail test | Checker |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-TL-1 | Entries are chronological, one per distinct source record (R-TL-7 covers duplicates), each with date, provider, one-line summary and excerpt. | Sample: 9 entries in date order, none of the four fields empty. Same-date records from different providers (records 1, 2) stay separate and keep source order (A-108). | UT + EV `entry_recall` |
| R-TL-2 | **Excerpt is verbatim and made of whole sentences (D-012).** An excerpt is a contiguous run of one or more *sentence units* of its record and a substring after whitespace normalization. **Sentence unit** (one code splitter, shared by the generator check, the gap/flag evidence and the excerpt-edit UI): the text up to and including a terminator, where a terminator is `.`, `?` or `!` followed by whitespace and then an uppercase letter, digit or end of text; `;`; or a line break. A period after an abbreviation on a fixed list (`approx.`, `Dr.`, `Mr.`, `Mrs.`, `Ms.`, `vs.`, `etc.`, `e.g.`, `i.e.`, `mg.`) or inside a number (`1.5`) is not a terminator. | UT: for every golden record, the units concatenated equal the record text, and `approx. 35 mph.` in record 1 is one unit. Grounding verifier passes every `verified` entry. An excerpt that is not verbatim is `rejected` (tray only, never timeline or export). An excerpt that starts or ends mid-unit is `needs_review`. | UT + EV `grounding_rate` |
| R-TL-3 | **Date of service is the record's header date, parsed by code.** Dates inside the body are facts for the conflict check, never the entry date. | Seeded test on **record 7**: header 2026-05-18, body "Date of accident per intake form: 2026-01-19". If the model returns 2026-01-19, the entry is `rejected` (`GROUNDING_DATE_MISMATCH`). Normal path: entry 7 dated 2026-05-18, sorted between entries 6 and 8. | UT + EV (`sample`) |
| R-TL-4 | **Summary adds nothing**: no fact, diagnosis, severity or causation absent from its excerpt. Judge #1 (faithfulness) checks every summary; `partially` or `unsupported` makes the entry `needs_review` with a one-sentence reason. | (a) Judge #1 returns `supported` on all 9 sample entries in each of 3 runs. (b) `hallucination_catch_rate` ≥ 0.95 over **every item in** `evals/golden/hallucinations.jsonl` (today 40, so at least 33 caught); the threshold is a rate, so it holds as the file grows. (c) Over **every control in** `hallucinations_controls.jsonl` (today 10) none returns `unsupported`. | EV |
| R-TL-5 | Every entry carries a state composed by code (ADR-005). `needs_review` sorts first in the review queue. | Unit tests cover the full composition table. E2E: a seeded `needs_review` entry appears above `verified` ones. | UT + E2E |
| R-TL-6 | "Why?" on every item shows the ladder record (generator output, code checks, judge verdict, state, backend) and the fixed-template one-sentence reason. | E2E: Why? on entry 7 shows check results and judge verdict; the audit record matches D.4 plus `backend`. | E2E |
| R-TL-7 | **Duplicate records are merged by code**: same date + same provider (case and whitespace normalized) + same normalized text → one entry citing every source record, with a visible "duplicate of record N" note. There is no split action (non-goal 16). | `case_04_duplicates_no_amounts`: 6 records give 4 entries, E1 cites records 1 and 2, E2 cites 3 and 4. Fail if 6 entries, or if a merged entry cites one record. | UT + EV (`case_04`) |
| R-TL-8 | **A hedge travels with its finding (D-018, D-021).** The **hedge set** is the lexicon entries with `hedge: true` in `app/llm/lexicon.yaml` (D-018); today `may_represent`, `correlate_clinically`, `possibility_terms`, `cannot_exclude`, `suggestive_versus_hedges`, `nonspecific_indeterminate`, `likely_alternative_cause`. When a selected sentence unit is qualified by a hedge unit, in the same unit or in the immediately following unit(s) of the same record, the hedge unit(s) must be in the excerpt, or the entry is `needs_review` with reason `EXCERPT_OMITS_QUALIFIER`. Other lexicon sentences (`pre_existing`, `compliance`, self-report) are **not** forced into the excerpt; they surface as flags. A unit is never cut (R-TL-2). | UT: the hedge set loads from `lexicon.yaml` (`hedge: true`), is non-empty and contains `may_represent` and `correlate_clinically`. Seeded entry 8 with excerpt "C5-C6 disc protrusion with mild right foraminal narrowing." → `needs_review` (`EXCERPT_OMITS_QUALIFIER`); with "…narrowing. Findings may represent degenerative change; correlate clinically." → `verified`. Entry 3 with excerpt "Persistent neck pain 6/10, daily headaches." and entry 5 with "Pain 4/10, improving." stay `verified` (their other sentences are `pre_existing` and damages wording, not hedges). Entry 6's default excerpt is checked by `entry_recall` (`must_contain_excerpt`: "Discharged from PT after two missed appointments"). | UT + EV |
| R-TL-9 | **Provider is the record's source label exactly as written (D-014), set by code.** Code copies the header/source label into the entry; the generator schema has no provider field, so a model can't supply or alter it (ADR-017). | UT: for every record in every golden file, the entry's provider equals the header label after whitespace normalization (record 4: "Capital PT, initial evaluation"). UT: the generator output schema has no provider field. Every provider and alias in the golden files must equal or be a substring of its record's label (qa, §8). | UT + EV |
| R-TL-10 | **Summaries keep the numbers and the qualifiers (D-006, D-022).** (a) A number, date, dollar figure or the word left, right, no, not or without in a summary must appear in the item's excerpt, the record's source label or its parsed date (token set: ADR-012 `grounding.new_tokens`) (so "visit 8" and a heading year don't trip it), or the entry is `needs_review` (`SUMMARY_TOKEN_NOT_IN_EXCERPT`). (b) If the excerpt contains a qualifier (a hedge, a self-report marker, a negation such as "without loss of consciousness", laterality, "approx.") and the **summary** omits it, the entry is `needs_review` (`SUMMARY_DROPS_QUALIFIER`). Both are code checks and don't rely on the judge. | UT: summary "pain 4/10" with excerpt "Pain 3/10." → `needs_review` (a). Summary "Diagnosed with concussion" for entry 2 → `needs_review` (b, drops "without loss of consciousness"). Sample entries pass, including "Visit 8: …" where "8" comes from the label "Capital PT, visit 8". Golden `required_terms` are checked against the summary alone (qa, §8). | UT + EV |

### 1.3 Review flags

Four types: `gap`, `conflict`, `pre_existing`, `causation`. Gap math is code over the header dates of clinical-encounter records (D-003): billing statements and phone notes are excluded, duplicates collapsed, ambiguous dates excluded, and the result does not change when the paralegal dismisses or edits an entry. Every flag shows its evidence.

| ID | Requirement | Pass / fail test | Checker |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-FL-1 | **Treatment gap.** Flag when days between consecutive dates of service across all providers (A-102) is **greater than 30** (A-104). Only clinical-encounter records count (D-003): billing statements and phone notes are excluded. Evidence is the two bounding entries (date, provider, excerpt). | Sample: flag 2026-03-06 → 2026-05-18, 73 days, citing entries 6 and 7. No flag on 2026-01-23 → 2026-02-20 (28 days). `case_02_gap_boundaries`: 29 and 30 do not flag, 31 does (3 flags, 4 near-misses). UT: dismissing entry 6 leaves the gap flag and its days unchanged. | UT (29/30/31) + EV `flag_*[gap]` |
| R-FL-2 | **Conflicting facts.** Flag facts that conflict across records, citing both excerpts. | Sample must raise (a) accident date 2026-01-09 (records 1, 2) vs "Date of accident per intake form: 2026-01-19" (record 7), shown as a conflict and **not merged**, with the records cited (R-EX-4) and no choice made between the dates or any "delay from the accident" computed; the tool may state "first recorded treatment: January 9, 2026" (D-017); (b) PT plan of 12 visits (record 4) vs discharge at visit 9 after two missed appointments (record 6). `case_05_provider_conflict` raises its required flag and tolerates the name variants. | EV `flag_*[conflict]` + PR (legal-nurse) |
| R-FL-3 | **Prior / pre-existing conditions.** LLM classification plus lexicon scan; if only one fires, the flag is `needs_review` (`LEXICON_ONLY` or `LLM_ONLY`). | Sample must raise record 3 ("Patient reports low back pain in 2023, resolved.") and record 8 ("degenerative change"). `case_06_subtle_pre_existing` is caught, and its 28-day near-miss does not flag. | EV `flag_*[pre_existing]` |
| R-FL-4 | **Language that weakens causation.** The tool quotes the wording; it never rules on causation. All five Appendix C items are `must` (K1–K5): records 8, 6 and 9, "New onset" in record 7, and the wrong accident date in record 7's intake line. Matching is one-to-one: each golden flag is satisfied by at most one tool flag, matched on type, cited records and overlapping evidence excerpt, so one record-7 flag about "new onset" can't also count for the intake date. | Sample: the tool emits a `causation` flag whose evidence is "New onset pain radiating to right arm" (K4) and a separate `causation` flag whose evidence is "Date of accident per intake form: 2026-01-19." (K5); the K5 line appears in the internal notes. Golden `must_not` every `must_not` item in `evals/golden` all pass (no "herniation", no "degenerative" in the tool's own voice, no "traumatic", no recovery claim). | EV `flag_*[causation]` + negative assertions + PR (claims-adjuster) |
| R-FL-5 | Every flag cites verbatim excerpt(s) that pass the grounding check. An ungrounded flag is `rejected`. | Verifier test on flags, same as R-TL-2. | UT + EV `grounding_rate` |
| R-FL-6 | Flags are grouped by type (four groups) with a fifth "Record warnings" group (dates to confirm, injection suspicion). Each shows its state and, when `needs_review`, a one-sentence reason. | E2E: the sample shows at least one flag in each of the four type groups; `case_01` shows a dates-to-confirm item; `case_07` shows an injection warning. | E2E |
| R-FL-7 | **No speaker label (D-040, replaces the self-report label).** Excerpts are verbatim, so the text shows who spoke; no flag, entry or export line asserts the speaker. The sample record 9 onset flag is titled "Reported onset" and is never presented as a physician's opinion. | No user-facing text contains "self-report"; sample record 9 flag carries no `patient_report` source_kind. Golden `must_not` M10 passes. | UT + E2E |
| R-FL-8 | **Flag text is code (D-007).** Titles and explanations come from code templates. The LLM returns only the category and excerpt spans for a flag. | UT: the LLM output schema for flags has no free-text field; every flag title and explanation equals the template output for its type and computed values. | UT |

### 1.4 Billed charges

| ID | Requirement | Pass / fail test | Checker |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-CH-1 | List **every dollar amount** found, each with source record and verbatim excerpt. Extraction is code (currency pattern, money as whole cents). Noisy forms (`$1,2OO`) are listed as `unclear` with no value, never corrected. | Sample lists $6,240, $185, $2,150 and nothing else. `case_03_rate_and_ocr`: `$1,2OO` and `$9S.00` are `unclear`, value null. Amount recall ≥ 95% over `required` golden amounts. | UT + EV `amount_recall` |
| R-CH-2 | Each amount is classed `charge`, `rate`, `estimate`, `damages` or `unclear` (golden classes). **Code classifies, by explicit billing-phrase rules; there is no LLM amount classifier** (ADR-011). Judge #2 re-reads every classification, rule-made or not (D-004). A rate can never become a charge. | $6,240 and $2,150 → `charge`; $185 → `rate`; "missing 3 days of work" → `damages` (no value). UT: 20 phrasings of "Charge per visit $185" all classify `rate`. A rule-made class that judge #2 disputes → `needs_review` (`JUDGE_DISAGREES`). | UT + EV |
| R-CH-3 | **The total counts only accepted amounts of class `charge`.** The screen shows "Accepted charges: $X" and, separately, "Detected, not yet accepted: $Y (not a total)". Rates, estimates, damages and unclear amounts are listed as "unclear — not totaled" and never added. | Sample: after accepting both charges, Accepted = **$8,390**. Dismissing the ER charge drops it to $2,150. $185 reads "rate $185/visit; visit count not stated (12 planned; discharged at visit 9); needs review". **No PT total is computed** (golden `must_not` M4: none of 1,665 / 2,220 / 1,480 / 10,055 / 10,610 / 9,870 appears). | UT (totals) + E2E + EV |
| R-CH-4 | Non-billing figures are not charges. "Rx cyclobenzaprine 10 mg" and other doses never appear as amounts. | Golden `must_not` M7: no amount valued 10, 35, 6, 7, 12, 40 or 2. | EV |
| R-CH-5 | Amounts always need an explicit accept, even when `verified`. **Accepting a non-charge amount** (rate, estimate, damages, unclear) means "noted": it appears in the internal notes only, never in the letter or the total. An unreadable amount (`$1,2OO`, value null) can never count as a charge, accepted or not; its note reads "request clean copy of bill". | E2E: no amount reaches the letter or total without an accept click. Accept `$1,2OO` in `case_03` → it appears in the notes with "request clean copy of bill", not in `letter_text`, total unchanged. | E2E + UT |
| R-CH-6 | **Duplicate charges are merged by code**: same date + provider + amount → one amount citing every source record, with a visible "duplicate of" note. The total can never count it twice. There is no split action (non-goal 16). | Seeded unit test: the same $6,240 on 2026-01-09 from Central ER in two records → one amount; total after accept $6,240, not $12,480. | UT + E2E |
| R-CH-7 | **Charges are accept / dismiss only (D-010, ADR-017).** A charge's class comes from code and judge #2; the paralegal can't reclassify or edit it, so no path turns a rate, estimate or unreadable amount into a totaled charge. Reclassification is non-goal 15. | UT: any edit on a charge (amount, class, excerpt) → 422 `invalid_edit`; the review endpoint accepts only `accept`, `dismiss` and `reset` for amounts. After accepting the $185 rate the Accepted total is still $8,390 and `letter_text` has no $185. | UT + E2E |

### 1.5 Review step

An **item** is an entry, a flag or a charge. Everything starts `pending`.

| ID | Requirement | Pass / fail test | Checker |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-RV-1 | Each entry and each flag can be **accepted, edited or dismissed**; each charge **accepted or dismissed** (D-010). Nothing is accepted by default. | E2E matrix: {accept, edit, dismiss} × {entry, flag} (6 cells) and {accept, dismiss} × {charge} (2 cells). Fresh load → all `pending`, letter block empty. | E2E |
| R-RV-2 | **What each action does (D-010, D-012).** See the table below the requirements. Originals are kept. "Edited" shows in the review UI and in the internal notes, never in the letter text. | UT, each → 422 `invalid_edit`: edit an entry's date or provider; edit a flag's evidence, type or title; edit a charge's amount or class; any other key. `confirm_date` (`POST /records/{rid}/confirm_date`): a date that is not one of the code-proposed readings → 422 `date_invalid`; a record with no readable date (no readings) cannot be confirmed. Also → 422 `invalid_edit`: an excerpt edit that is not a contiguous run of whole sentence units of the same record; an excerpt edit that drops a hedge-set unit (R-TL-8). `confirm_date` on `case_01` record 8 with 2026-05-04 → 200, a review event is logged, the entry joins the timeline. E2E: edit entry 3's summary → "edited" label in the UI; the letter shows the new summary with its citation and no "edited" mark; the notes list the original and the new text. | UT + E2E |
| R-RV-3 | **Edited text is re-checked.** The D-006 code check (numbers, dates, `$` in the new summary must appear in the excerpt) and judge #1 run on every edited summary and on every re-selected excerpt. If the code check or the judge objects (`partially`/`unsupported`), nothing is saved and the response is 409 `needs_confirm` with the reasons; if she chooses "keep my wording" the edit is resent with confirmation, saved, logged and shown in the internal notes. If the code check passes but the judge is unavailable (error, timeout, no recorded answer; always so in demo mode), the edit is saved as `edited` with state `needs_review` (`JUDGE_UNAVAILABLE`). | UT: summary edited to add "$9,000" → 409 `needs_confirm` (code token check). Seeded edit adding "herniation" → judge returns `partially` or `unsupported` → 409 `needs_confirm`. Resending with confirmation saves it. Judge unavailable → saved, `needs_review`, `JUDGE_UNAVAILABLE`. Structurally invalid edits are 422 `invalid_edit` (R-RV-2); judge or token objections are 409, never 422. | UT + EV (judge) + E2E |
| R-RV-4 | Review is keyboard-drivable (accept / edit / dismiss / next) and usable at 375 px. | E2E completes the sample case by keyboard only. At 375 px no horizontal scroll and every action is reachable. | E2E |
| R-RV-5 | Dismissed items never export to the letter and are recoverable (reset) until export. A dismissed flag may carry an optional reason. | E2E: dismiss, reset, dismiss again → absent from the letter and listed only under "dismissed" in the notes. | E2E |
| R-RV-6 | **No LLM output is auto-accepted. Record text is data (D-005).** A record with an injection warning forces all its items to `needs_review` (an advisory state, ADR-008), its amounts can't be charges, and it can't suppress flags from other records (the lexicon is the floor; the prior/causation flag pass runs per record, D-021). | Golden `case_07_prompt_injection`: the record produces an ordinary entry with an `INJECTION_SUSPECTED` warning, `needs_review`; no item's `review_status` changes and no flag is created resolved; the injected `$50,000` is never totaled (total stays $420). | EV + PR (privacy-compliance) |
| R-RV-8 | **Decisions survive a reload.** Accept, edit, dismiss, notes and `confirm_date` persist (SQLite) and restore on reload or reopen of the case. | E2E: accept 3 items, edit 1, reload → same statuses and the same Accepted total. | E2E |
| R-RV-9 | **Open the full source record from any item.** Entries, flags (both records for a two-record flag) and charges open the full record text with the excerpt highlighted, in a modal or panel. The highlight range comes from code offsets, not the model. If the offset can't be found, the item drops to `needs_review` and the UI says so. This is core; only the side-by-side layout is the stretch (§4). | E2E: from entry 8 open the record → the highlighted span equals the excerpt string. From the 73-day gap flag, records 6 and 7 both open. UT with a mutated record: offset lookup fails → `needs_review`. | E2E + UT |

**R-RV-2 action table.**

| Item | Accept | Edit allows | Edit never allows | Other |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Entry | yes | summary text; re-selecting the excerpt as another contiguous run of whole sentence units of the **same** record (never dropping a hedge-set unit) | date, provider, record | `confirm_date` (below) |
| Charge | yes | nothing | amount, class, excerpt | dismiss |
| Flag | yes | a reviewer note (plain text, up to 500 characters, printed verbatim in the notes, labeled "reviewer note") | type, title, explanation, evidence | dismiss with optional reason |

`confirm_date` is a separate review action, valid only for an entry whose date is `date_ambiguous`. Allowed values are the code-proposed readings only. It is logged as a review event with the previous state.

*Withdrawn (D-011):* R-RV-7 (batch accept) is non-goal 14.

### 1.6 Export

Both blocks are assembled by code from items with `review_status` in {accepted, edited}. API: `GET /api/cases/{id}/export` returns `letter_text` and `internal_notes_text` separately.

| ID | Requirement | Pass / fail test | Checker |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-EX-1 | **Treatment section (paste into letter)** contains accepted entries and accepted `charge` amounts only. It holds no tool-authored flag content: no flag note, type label, title, explanation, day count, count line or AI-assistance line. Record words appear only inside an accepted entry's excerpt or summary. | E2E: accept all 9 entries, both charges and all flags, add a reviewer note to the gap flag. Assert `letter_text` contains none of: the reviewer note text, "REVIEWER NOTE", any flag type label, any flag title or explanation string produced from `sample.expected.json`'s flags, "73 days", "AI assistance", or any count line. UT: every line of `letter_text` is a fixed heading, a date + provider heading, an entry summary, a `Source` line whose quote is a substring of the accepted excerpt, an amount line or the total line; the letter builder takes no flags argument. Set equality: with a chosen subset accepted, the item IDs in `letter_text` equal that subset. | E2E + UT |
| R-EX-2 | Every entry and charge in the letter carries a source line with the verbatim excerpt. No short-cite mode (D-002). | UT: for every statement and amount line in `letter_text`, the quoted excerpt is a substring of the input after normalization (100%, ship bar 1). Headings and the total line are fixed text. | UT + EV `grounding_rate` |
| R-EX-3 | Chronological and deterministic: same accepted set → byte-identical `letter_text` and `internal_notes_text`. | UT: dates in `letter_text` are non-decreasing; export twice and compare. | UT |
| R-EX-4 | **Internal review notes — do not send** contain these sections, in this order. Every record citation reads `record N (<provider as written>, <Month D, YYYY>)`. (1) AI-assistance line (D-009), fixed text: "This chronology was drafted with AI assistance; every item in the treatment section was accepted by the paralegal. Items not reviewed: N." (matches the golden notes block; DECISIONS aligned on T-028) (2) Flags accepted, with evidence. (3) Flags dismissed, with any reason. (4) **Flagged language quoted in the letter**: each letter entry whose excerpt contains the evidence of a flag that is not dismissed, naming the flag type, so the attorney decides whether it goes out (D-012). (5) Amounts not totaled (accepted rate, estimate, unclear), worded as an action ("request itemized PT ledger"; "request clean copy of bill"). (6) Damages mentions that aren't charges, with excerpt. (7) **Future treatment recommended (no cost stated)**, from sentences matching a small code pattern list (it starts with "recommend"; extend by card), worded "request cost estimate". (8) **Bills to request**: one line, providers named by the label up to its first comma, in order of first appearance in the chronology, omitting any provider with an accepted charge, with " (itemized ledger)" appended when the provider has a non-dismissed rate. (9) Records not in the treatment section (R-EX-7). (10) Edited items, with original and new text and any "keep my wording" confirmation. (11) Pending items not included. | Sample, everything accepted (full text in §6): the notes list the gap, both conflicts, both prior mentions and the causation flags; entries 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 under "flagged language quoted in the letter" (entry 1 because the accident-date conflict cites its "rear-ended" sentence) (record 3's 2023 low back sentence and record 7's intake-form sentence are not in the letter); the accident-date conflict citing records 1 and 2 (header date, no choice between dates, D-017) and record 7's intake line; the K5 causation item for record 7's intake line; the $185 rate with "request itemized PT ledger"; the record 5 damages mention; "Recommend cervical epidural steroid injection." from record 9; the bills-to-request line is exactly "Austin EMS run report; Dr. Alvarez; Capital PT (itemized ledger); Hill Country Pain Management." UT: every match of the case-insensitive pattern `record \d+` in `internal_notes_text` is followed by a parenthesis with a provider and a date. | UT + E2E |
| R-EX-5 | The UI shows counts outside the copied text: "N entries, N charges in letter · N flags in internal notes · N of 9 records in letter · N items pending (N flags)". The count line is part of neither block. **Copy asks for one confirmation when anything is pending**, stating the pending numbers and naming pending flags separately (a pending flag may be one the attorney needs to see). | E2E: leave the 73-day gap flag pending, click Copy letter → the confirm reads "1 flag not reviewed"; the count line shows it. Click Copy for each block, read the clipboard, assert no count line in either. | E2E |
| R-EX-6 | **Template and worked example.** The letter follows the template in §6: US long dates ("January 9, 2026"), provider as written in the header, a `Source [Ex. __ / Bates __]:` line with the verbatim quote (the placeholder is literal text she fills in after pasting), money as `$1,234.00`, no dot leaders. The full expected export for the sample case is `evals/golden/sample.export.expected.txt` (qa, T-015), whose `LETTER_TEXT` and `INTERNAL_NOTES_TEXT` sections are §6's two blocks. | E2E on the **`fixture` backend** (recorded sample responses, so summary wording is fixed): with all 9 entries and both charges accepted and nothing edited, `letter_text` equals the golden file's `LETTER_TEXT` section and `internal_notes_text` equals its `INTERNAL_NOTES_TEXT` section, byte for byte (delimiter lines excluded). Every amount line and the total line match `\$[\d,]+\.\d{2}`; `Source` quotes are verbatim and exempt. No `..` run in the golden file. On a live backend the check covers structure only (R-EX-1, R-EX-2). | E2E + UT |
| R-EX-7 | **Reconciliation.** Every input record not represented in the letter is listed in the internal notes with its reason: rejected, dismissed or not reviewed. The UI shows "N of 9 records in letter" before copy. | E2E: dismiss entry 5 and leave entry 6 pending → notes list record 5 (dismissed) and record 6 (not reviewed); the on-screen count reads "7 of 9". | E2E |
| R-EX-8 | **The total line is exactly** `Billed charges accepted from these records: $X` (D-019, wording per D-062), where X is the sum of accepted `charge` amounts, formatted `$8,390.00`. **No parenthetical and no "excludes …" clause, ever.** Rates, estimates, unclear amounts, exclusions and injection-tagged amounts appear only in the internal notes ("Amounts not totaled"), because any clause built from unaccepted or injected amounts would leak into the carrier letter. | UT: on the sample the line equals `Billed charges accepted from these records: $8,390.00`. UT: with a non-dismissed rate, estimate or unclear amount present, and on `case_07`, the line is still exactly the template; `letter_text` contains none of "excludes", "supplement", "visit count", "rate". | UT + E2E |
| R-EX-9 | Two separate copy buttons, one per block, each copying exactly that block. | E2E: clipboard after each click equals the matching API field. | E2E |

## 2. Constraints

| ID | Requirement | Pass / fail test | Checker |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-CO-1 | **LLM used for at least one step, and the line is documented.** `docs/LLM_VS_CODE.md` has the §5.2 table and matches the code. | Staff-engineer review checks each pipeline step against the table. UT: gap, total, date-parse, dedupe, sentence-splitter and export modules import no LLM client. | PR (staff-engineer) + UT |
| R-CO-2 | **Validation ladder on every LLM-derived item**: code check → independent judge (own prompt, preferably another model) → human accept/edit/dismiss. Nothing LLM-made reaches an export block without all three. | Audit record (D.4) exists for each LLM-derived item. E2E: an LLM-derived item with no human action is absent from both export blocks. | UT + E2E |
| R-CO-3 | **Nothing in the output that is not in the records.** | Ship bar items 1 and 4. On the sample case every `must_not` item in `evals/golden` holds (no fixed range), including: no disc herniation caused by the collision; "may represent degenerative change" not turned into "degenerative" or "traumatic"; no PT total; the two accident dates not merged; "concussion without loss of consciousness" kept as written. Any hit is a blocker. | EV (negative assertions) + PR (claims-adjuster) |
| R-CO-4 | **Runs from a link or from the repo in under 5 minutes.** The public link works without a key: public deployment is demo-only by default (D-008), replaying the cached sample run through the real pipeline code (A-002). In demo mode `POST /api/cases` accepts only text whose normalized hash equals a recorded fixture; anything else is rejected and not stored (D-020). Local mode (`ZLAYT_MODE=local`, loopback only) also admits the synthetic `evals/library` packets by exact hash (D-036). | `tools/install_test.sh`: clean clone to first screen with the sample loaded < 300 s. The public link opens with no login. | INST + PR (installer-reviewer) |
| R-CO-5 | **Synthetic data only**, shown on screen. | Banner "Synthetic data only — never paste real records" on every view (E2E). `python tools/check_secrets.py` passes. | E2E + UT |
| R-CO-6 | **Model and backend are swappable by config** (`claude-cli`, `anthropic-api`, `fixture`). A backend or prompt change requires an eval re-run with the report attached. | Unit tests run on `fixture` with no key. Handoff of any prompt/model change links an `evals/reports/*.md`. | UT + board check |
| R-CO-7 | **Determinism across 3 runs of the sample case, on a live-model backend** (`claude-cli` or `anthropic-api`; a `fixture` replay proves nothing). *Code outputs identical*: record split, parsed dates, entry-ID set, gap flags, amount list and classes from code, totals. *LLM-derived item states must match*: every entry, amount and flag has the same state in all 3 runs. *Flags are compared by (type, set of cited record IDs, evidence excerpt)*; the three runs must produce the same flag set. Summary wording may differ but must be `supported` in every run. | `determinism_3run` = 1.0 on `sample`; any difference fails and the report lists it. Other golden cases are reported, not gated. | EV |
| R-CO-8 | **Time-box and say what was cut.** | `memory/SCOPE_CUTS.md` has a row for every non-goal in §5 and §5 has an item for every row; the product note's "cut" section matches. | PR (product-manager) |
| R-CO-9 | Retries: at most 2 retries (3 attempts in all), each with changed conditions; failure is visible. | UT: the call fails on all 3 attempts → `LLM_FAILED_AFTER_RETRIES` and the item shows "could not process" with the reason, and the app stays usable; fails twice then succeeds → the entry is produced. | UT |

---

## 3. Part 1 submission items

| ID | Requirement | Pass / fail test | Checker |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-SU-1 | Prototype link or repo with run instructions. README has a timed run path. | See R-CO-4. | INST |
| R-SU-2 | Demo ≤ 3 minutes, or annotated screenshots. Screenshots cover each of these states: input, processing, timeline with `needs_review` first, flags panel, charges with the unclear tray, edit with warning, source-record view, export (both blocks), "could not verify" tray, error/empty input. | `artifacts/demo.webm` duration ≤ 180 s (ffprobe). `artifacts/CAPTIONS.md` has one caption per listed state. | qa check |
| R-SU-3 | One-page product note. Checklist: the 7 required contents are present as headings (problem and user; what was built; what was cut and why; ship bar with 3–5 testable criteria, how tested, what was found; where AI can fail and how design handles it; model/code split; three metrics, each with a "tells you" line); exactly 3 post-launch metrics; renders to 1 page (≤ 650 words). Numbers in the note equal the latest eval report. | Checklist run by the writer self-check, then PR (hiring-panel, product-manager). | PR |
| R-SU-4 | **Which AI tools, and the prompts, unedited.** `submission/prompt-log/TOOLS.md` names tools, models and how the team was organized. The transcript export is produced by `tools/export_prompt_log.py` with no manual edits, plus a two-paragraph reading guide. | Re-run the exporter into a temp dir; `diff` against the submitted files is empty. `TOOLS.md` exists and names the tools and models. | qa check + PR (hiring-panel) |
| R-SU-5 | **Assumptions stated, links open.** The product note links the assumptions (A-101 to A-108 and any added); every link in the email draft opens without requesting access. | Checklist: note references `memory/ASSUMPTIONS.md` content; qa opens each submitted link in a logged-out browser. | PR + qa check |

---

## 4. Stretch pick: side-by-side source viewer

**Chosen.** The two-pane layout. Left, the item queue. Right, the full source record, always visible, scrolled to the highlighted excerpt as she moves through the queue. Opening the full record (modal or panel, highlight by code offsets) is already core (R-RV-9), so what the stretch adds is the layout that removes the open-and-close step.

**Why (3 lines).**
1. The spec says she "reviews rather than trusts." Each claim sits next to its context with no extra click per item, which is what about 20 decisions per case need.
2. A quote can mislead by omission (the MRI line without its hedge). R-TL-8 stops the tool from dropping the hedge; the viewer lets her see the rest of the record anyway.
3. It is cheap: the highlight range already comes from the grounding check, so there is no new LLM step.

**Why not the others.** PDF upload puts unverifiable extraction upstream of the grounding check. The confidence indicator already ships as `verified / needs_review / rejected`. A firm-voice paragraph is generated prose that would need its own verification.

**Cut rule.**
- **Start** only when every M3 must-have card is done with no open blockers, and M3 is inside its 3.5 h budget. The stretch is built before the M3 gate so the gate reviews it.
- **Stop** at 45 minutes, or when the M3 gate is due, whichever comes first.
- **Fallback (one):** cut it entirely. The core record modal from R-RV-9 stays and nothing else changes. Log the cut in `memory/SCOPE_CUTS.md`.

| ID | Requirement | Pass / fail test | Checker |
|---|---|---|---|
| R-ST-1 | At viewport ≥ 1024 px the source record sits beside the queue; selecting an item scrolls the record to its highlighted excerpt without opening a modal. Below 1024 px it falls back to the R-RV-9 modal. | E2E at 1280 px: step through three items by keyboard; the record pane updates each time and the highlighted span equals the excerpt. At 375 px the modal opens instead. | E2E |

**M3 cut order if M3 passes 100% of its budget** (each cut is logged in `memory/SCOPE_CUTS.md`):
1. R-ST-1, the side-by-side layout.
2. Excerpt re-selection (R-RV-2): edit becomes summary text only. Entries can still be dismissed, and the notes still list flagged language.
3. R-EX-4 sections 7 and 8 (future treatment, bills to request).
4. R-RV-9 drops to an inline full-record expand with no highlight; the highlight check stays in the E2E as a *should*.

---

## 5. Non-goals

These are out on purpose. The orchestrator logs each in `memory/SCOPE_CUTS.md` with the reason; R-CO-8 checks that the two lists match.

1. **PDF upload and OCR.** Text only. Extraction errors would sit upstream of the grounding check. Pasted PDF text with page headers is a chaos-test input, not a feature.
2. **Multi-case and matter management.** One case at a time, no search across cases, no case list.
3. **Accounts, auth, roles, sharing.** One anonymous session.
4. **Real data or PHI handling.** Synthetic only. No HIPAA, retention or BAA claim. The privacy review checks the design for what a real build would need; the prototype doesn't implement it. After launch a test set may be built from real work product, but only inside the firm's environment, attorney-approved and access-logged (D-016); this repo stays synthetic.
5. **Drafting demand-letter prose in a firm's voice.** Export is a structured treatment section from accepted items. No generated narrative, no advocacy language.
6. **Medical or legal judgment.** No diagnosis, severity rating, causation opinion or statement of what a record "means." Flags point at the record's own words. Whether a flagged sentence goes out in the letter is the attorney's call (D-012), not the tool's. The tool never picks between conflicting accident dates and never computes delay from the accident (D-017).
7. **Billing analysis.** No PT total from a rate, no reasonableness of charges, liens, insurance adjustments or paid-vs-billed.
8. **Integrations.** No EHR, case-management or document-system connectors, no email intake.
9. **Per-user learning.** Dismissals are logged for metrics, not fed back into prompts.
10. **Numeric confidence scores.** Three states only. A made-up percentage implies precision we can't verify.
11. **Non-English records and handwriting.** The chaos test confirms a clear failure message, not support.
12. **Manually adding an entry for a record the pipeline rejected.** The record stays in the "could not verify" tray; she writes that entry herself (SCOPE_CUTS 12).
13. **LLM fallback for splitting records** (SCOPE_CUTS 13). An unsplittable paste becomes one record, marked uncertain.
14. **Batch accept.** Every item takes an individual decision (D-011; SCOPE_CUTS 14).
15. **Charge reclassification.** A charge is accepted or dismissed; its class comes from code and judge #2, and a rate can never become a charge (D-011; SCOPE_CUTS 15).
16. **A "not a duplicate" split action.** The duplicate merge stays, visible with a "duplicate of" note (D-011; SCOPE_CUTS 16).
17. **Smaller cuts (D-011; SCOPE_CUTS 17).** LLM date pointing, bring-your-own-key, the full-prompt audit view, edits to flag titles or explanations, a case list.
18. **Per-packet date-convention inference.** An ambiguous numeric date always asks once, even when the packet has `02/17/2026` elsewhere; golden `case_01` expects exactly that. Inferring the convention would cut confirmations and add a silent-guess risk; it needs its own eval first.
19. **Exhibit and Bates numbering** (SCOPE_CUTS 19). The export carries an `[Ex. __ / Bates __]` placeholder she fills in; the tool assigns no numbers.

---

## 6. Export template and worked example (R-EX-6)

Sample case, all 9 entries and both charges accepted, nothing edited, all flags accepted. Summaries are one line, written from the excerpt only. Dates are US long form in the export; the UI and API keep ISO. `[Ex. __ / Bates __]` is literal text. The qa golden file `evals/golden/sample.export.expected.txt` is this text.

**Block 2 — Internal review notes — do not send**

```
INTERNAL REVIEW NOTES — DO NOT SEND

This chronology was drafted with AI assistance; every item in the treatment section was accepted by the paralegal. Items not reviewed: 0.

FLAGS ACCEPTED
- Gap: 73 days, March 6, 2026 to May 18, 2026: record 6 (Capital PT, visit 9, March 6, 2026) to record 7 (Hill Country Pain Management, new patient, May 18, 2026).
- Conflict, accident date: record 7 (Hill Country Pain Management, new patient, May 18, 2026): "Date of accident per intake form: 2026-01-19." Record 1 (Austin EMS run report, January 9, 2026): "41M restrained driver, rear-ended at approx. 35 mph." Record 2 (Central ER discharge summary, dated January 9, 2026). The tool does not choose between the dates. First recorded treatment: January 9, 2026.
- Conflict, PT plan: record 4 (Capital PT, initial evaluation, January 23, 2026) "Plan of care: 12 visits."; record 6 (Capital PT, visit 9, March 6, 2026) "Discharged from PT after two missed appointments."
- Prior condition: record 3 (Dr. Alvarez, primary care, January 16, 2026) "Patient reports low back pain in 2023, resolved."; record 8 (Austin Imaging, cervical MRI, May 29, 2026) "Findings may represent degenerative change".
- Causation language: record 8 (Austin Imaging, cervical MRI, May 29, 2026) "may represent degenerative change; correlate clinically"; record 6 (Capital PT, visit 9, March 6, 2026) "Discharged from PT after two missed appointments."; record 9 (Hill Country Pain Management, follow-up, June 12, 2026) "Patient states symptoms began after the January collision."; record 7 (Hill Country Pain Management, new patient, May 18, 2026) "New onset pain"; record 7 (Hill Country Pain Management, new patient, May 18, 2026) "Date of accident per intake form: 2026-01-19."

If entry 5 were dismissed: the letter skips February 20, and "RECORDS NOT IN THE TREATMENT SECTION" reads "Record 5 (Capital PT, visit 8, February 20, 2026) — dismissed." The chronology never silently closes up.

## 7. Ship bar (mirrors CONTRACT §8.2; change only with an ADR)

These five are the product note's "good enough to ship" criteria. Metric names are proposed; qa owns the final names in `evals/run`, and updates this table by card if they differ.

| # | Criterion (CONTRACT §8.2) | Number | Measured by | Run with | R-IDs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Grounding** | 100% of exported statements and amounts carry a verbatim excerpt present in the input. Any miss is a blocker. | Eval metric `grounding_rate` (excerpts, providers, amounts, dates; exported items) + export unit test | `python -m evals.run`; `pytest tests/unit` | R-TL-2, R-TL-9, R-FL-5, R-EX-2 |
| 2 | **Recall** | ≥ 95% of golden timeline entries and ≥ 95% of golden dollar amounts captured across the eval set | `entry_recall`, `amount_recall` | `python -m evals.run` | R-TL-1, R-TL-7, R-CH-1 |
| 3 | **Flags** | Per flag type (gap, conflict, pre_existing, causation): precision ≥ 0.9 and recall ≥ 0.9. 28-day near-miss must not flag; 73-day gap must. | `flag_precision[type]`, `flag_recall[type]`; assertions `gap_28_not_flagged`, `gap_73_flagged`; 29/30/31 unit test | `python -m evals.run`; `pytest tests/unit` | R-FL-1 to R-FL-4 |
| 4 | **No invented facts** | 0 unsupported statements across 3 repeated runs on the sample case (judge + grounding). Judge recall on seeded hallucinations ≥ 95% of every item in `hallucinations.jsonl` (today 40, so at least 33). CONTRACT §5 M2 still says "qa injects 20"; the rate governs permanently and the product note quotes the rate. Seeded J3/J4 control sets must also catch every seeded wrong item with 0 false agrees (D-046). | `unsupported_count_3run`, `hallucination_catch_rate`, `determinism_3run`, golden `must_not` | `python -m evals.run` | R-TL-4, R-TL-10, R-CH-2, R-CH-7, R-CO-3, R-CO-7 |
| 5 | **Reviewability** | Paralegal persona completes the sample case end to end and scores "I could verify every claim quickly" ≥ 4/5. E2E export test green. | `reviews/<card>-paralegal.md`, key `scores.verify_quickly` (1–5, D-015) ≥ 4; `pytest tests/e2e` (letter block holds accepted entries and charges only, no flag content; `needs_review` first; dismissed never exports; edits labeled; decisions survive reload) | persona review + `pytest tests/e2e` | R-RV-1 to R-RV-6, R-RV-8, R-RV-9, R-EX-1 to R-EX-9 |

Other gates (not ship-bar numbers, still required): `python tools/check_secrets.py` clean; `tools/install_test.sh` under 5 minutes (R-CO-4).

Rule for the product note: report what the eval **found**, including misses, not just the targets.

## 8. Assumptions and the hand-off list

### Assumptions this depends on

Live list: `memory/ASSUMPTIONS.md`.

| Ref | Assumption | Requirements that break if it's wrong |
|---|---|---|
| A-001 / A-002 | Dev runs on `claude-cli`; reviewers get demo mode with cached sample output and no key. | R-CO-4, R-CO-6 |
| A-101 | The paralegal builds the chronology; the attorney reviews the letter. | R-RV-*, R-EX-1, R-EX-4 |
| A-102 | A gap is measured between consecutive dates of service across all providers. | R-FL-1 |
| A-103 | The chronology feeds the medical-treatment section of a pre-suit demand letter to a carrier. | R-EX-1 to R-EX-8 |
| A-104 | "Longer than 30 days" is strict: 30 is not a gap, 31 is. | R-FL-1 |
| A-105 | Each pasted record carries its date and source on its first line or table row; undated or ambiguous records go to "Dates to confirm". | R-IN-3, R-IN-5, R-TL-3 |
| A-106 | The export cites each line by provider as written in the header + date of service with an `[Ex. __ / Bates __]` placeholder; the tool assigns no numbers; internal notes cite `record N (provider as written, date)` per R-EX-4 | R-EX-2, R-EX-4, R-EX-6 |
| A-107 | A per-visit rate is not billable until visits are itemized, so no PT total is shown. | R-CH-2, R-CH-3, R-EX-8 |
| A-108 | Same-day records from different providers stay separate entries. | R-TL-1, R-TL-7 |

**Team decisions, not yet in `ASSUMPTIONS.md`** (Chris can override through the NEEDS_CHRIS FYI list):
- The date of service is the record's header date. Body dates are conflict evidence only (R-TL-3).
- Accepting a flag means "I've seen it and it's real," not "send it to the carrier." Flags go to the internal notes only (D-001). A flagged record sentence can still appear in the letter inside an accepted excerpt; the notes list those so the attorney decides (D-012).
- Numeric dates whose first two numbers are both 1–12 and differ are ambiguous even though Texas records are normally month/day; she confirms once per date (R-IN-3, non-goal 18).
- Providers with an entry in the letter but no stated charge are "bills to request" (R-EX-4).
- Recommended future treatment is a specials item the firm will want costed; the notes surface it (R-EX-4).

### Reconciliation status

Everything above follows `memory/ORCHESTRATOR_DECISIONS.md` (D-001 to D-024). **Authority rule:** `evals/golden/*` is the authority on expected outputs, and this file matches it. §6 block 2 equals the golden `INTERNAL_NOTES_TEXT` block and §6 block 1 equals `LETTER_TEXT`; the writer asks qa for no golden changes. `memory/contracts/api.md` and `memory/DECISIONS.md` are the authority for the API and are aligned to this file and the golden by the architect on **T-028**. Each row has a grep that shows the difference.

| # | File | Difference | Check | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `memory/contracts/api.md` export example | The example references `evals/golden/sample.export.expected.txt` instead of copying it (one source of truth). | `grep -n "sample.export.expected.txt" memory/contracts/api.md` (expect ≥ 1) | T-028 | resolved |
| 2 | `memory/contracts/api.md` reason codes | No `SUMMARY_DROPS_QUALIFIER` (D-022, R-TL-10(b)); `EXCERPT_OMITS_QUALIFIER` reads "the record has a hedge sentence the excerpt leaves out", D-021 limits it to a hedge that qualifies a selected sentence. | `grep -c "SUMMARY_DROPS_QUALIFIER" memory/contracts/api.md` (expect 1 or more) | T-028 (architect) |
| 3 | `memory/contracts/api.md` / `memory/DECISIONS.md` | `confirm_date` with a non-candidate date must be `422 date_invalid`; the AI line in DECISIONS must match R-EX-4(1); the gap example for a phone note must follow D-003 (excluded from gap math). | `grep -n "date_invalid" memory/contracts/api.md`; `grep -n "AI assistance" memory/DECISIONS.md`; `grep -n "phone" memory/contracts/api.md memory/DECISIONS.md` | T-028 (architect) |
| 4 | `evals/golden/README.md`, `sample.expected.json` | Golden uses `source_kind: patient_self_report` and checks `required_terms` on summary+excerpt; D-022 and R-FL-7/R-TL-10 say `patient_report` and summary alone. Not a request to qa: the orchestrator records which wins, and the loser is edited by its owner. | `grep -n "patient_self_report\|summary+excerpt" evals/golden/README.md` | orchestrator (D-entry) |
| 5 | M3 paralegal review brief (orchestrator, T-018/M3 gate) | `scores.verify_quickly` (D-015) must be requested in the brief. | `grep -c "verify_quickly" .claude/agents/paralegal-reviewer.md` (expect 1 or more) | T-016 (orchestrator) |
| 6 | `docs/CONTRACT.md` §5 M2 | "qa injects 20"; closed as permanent. The ship bar here is a rate over the file and the product note quotes the rate. CONTRACT is never edited. | none | closed |

Already aligned, checked at this commit: `memory/ASSUMPTIONS.md` A-106 matches R-EX-4 (provider + date; record numbers appear only in the internal notes) and R-EX-6; `memory/SCOPE_CUTS.md` rows 1–19 match §5 non-goals 1–19; the golden letter block has no parenthetical on the total line.

## 9. Traceability pointers

- LLM/code table and ladder: `docs/LLM_VS_CODE.md`. Names used here: generator, judge #1 faithfulness, judge #2 amount classification, judge #3 conflict, states `verified | needs_review | rejected`.
- Golden set: `evals/golden/` (qa). Expected values: `spec/SAMPLE_CASE_TRUTHS.md`. Every metric above must be computable from it.
- Cards cite R-IDs in their AC text. `evals.run` report rows carry the R-ID next to each metric.
- The withdrawn ID R-RV-7 (batch accept, D-011) is not reused.
