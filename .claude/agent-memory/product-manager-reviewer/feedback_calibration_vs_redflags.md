description: Recurring dossier/review pattern — calibration examples graded softer than the persona's own dealbreakers or the spec's blocker definition; always cross-check

When reviewing persona dossiers (or any rubric that gets compiled into a reviewer prompt), cross-check every §8 calibration severity against the dossier's §5 red flags, Appendix A constraints, and CONTRACT.md:676 ("blocker = violates a spec constraint, invents or loses facts"). In the T-010/T-011 review (2026-11-02), 9 of 13 dossiers had dealbreakers anchored at major or minor. Examples: installer >5-min install rated major, a dropped LOC qualifier rated major, an invented "MRI performed" rated minor.

**Why:** calibration examples are the reviewer's severity anchors. Soft anchors build in the "identifies issue, then decides it's not a big deal" leniency failure.

**How to apply:** script a red-flag vs calibration grep (see artifacts/review-evidence/T-010-011-sections.txt) and treat each contradiction as a major against the dossier. Also check that PM/hiring-panel checklists cover every Part 2 sub-question by name (retention, first 30 days, the 3 AI ACs, keeping founders informed were missing). See [[part2-coverage]].

**Round 2 (T-011, commit 6559f5a, reviewed 2026-11-01): pass.** All anchors were fixed. Two things to watch for in later rounds:
- **Fix-induced over-breadth.** The new "Severity rule" line, "anything violating Appendix A ... is a blocker", is broader than D.2 and drops "unsafe". Check it against D.2 verbatim.
- **Catch-all items.** "Answers every sub-question" stands in for dedicated checks. Map each sub-question to a specific item. Still missing are: who first, why-this-first, rollout, collecting feedback, engineering's role, and the One story's three parts.
