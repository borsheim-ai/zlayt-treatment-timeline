description: Recurring NEEDS_CHRIS defects on this project. Rows are added without needs_chris cards, and questions that aren't Chris's (client practice, team product calls) get in. Check on every harness/submission review.

On every review that touches submission/NEEDS_CHRIS.md, check three things with commands:
1. **Row ↔ card parity.** Compare the row numbers in NEEDS_CHRIS.md with the `board.py list --status needs_chris` titles that contain "(NEEDS_CHRIS #n)", and check the priorities match. T-005 r1 had 0 of 1 rows carded; r2 had 2 of 10 (rows #4-#11 were added by the review-triage flow with no cards; row #1 was P1 in the file and P2 on the card).
2. **§11.5 scope.** Only things that genuinely need Chris belong there: his story, personal numbers, HF Space name, own-voice video, final send, credentials, spend. Questions about how "Zinda" (the fictional client in SPEC.md:8) works are discovery questions or ASSUMPTIONS, not Chris items. Product calls the team already made belong in ORCHESTRATOR_DECISIONS/ADRs. "Nothing to do" rows are FYIs.
3. **Exact action.** Each action names the expected reply ("demo-only" / "live with cap $X") rather than "Reply via inbox."

**Why:** The needs_chris column is what Chris sees on his phone, and the file is a graded submission artifact (§11.5 DoD). The file grows during review triage while the card step is skipped.

**T-005 r3 (2026-11-01):** parity was fixed at 3/3. The new defects were stale "NEEDS_CHRIS #n" references in D-entries and a garbled STATE heartbeat line in the working tree, which the RUNBOOK restart depends on. Always diff STATE.md against HEAD.

**How to apply:** Re-read the file at the end of the review, because it changed mid-review in T-005 r2. Also check that every ADR's stated facts match the running system (ADR-000e said http/no-TLS while https serve was live). See [[spec-review-patterns]].
