description: How the product note and Part 2 doc were built and page-fitted, where each number comes from, and pitfalls

Submission docs live in `submission/`: `product-note.md` (1 page), `part2-process.md` (4 pages), `validation-ladder.svg` (hand-written; `mmdc` is not installed), `print.css` (shared print style).

**Page-fit check (no LaTeX here):** `pandoc X.md -s -o /private/tmp/.../x.html --css submission/print.css --embed-resources --resource-path=submission`, then Chrome headless `--print-to-pdf --no-pdf-header-footer`, count `/Type /Page` in the PDF. Product note fits one page only at 8.7pt (~1000 words); Part 2 fits 4 pages at 9.4pt (~2700 words). T-188 does the real PDFs; reuse print.css.

**Round 2 (after PM review fail):** render with a scratch copy of print.css plus `body{font-size:Npt}` (script pattern: pandoc --css <copy> then Chrome). Product note needed ~1050 words at 8.7pt; table column widths (dash counts) and orphan last lines matter more than words. Cite only paths `git ls-files` knows: reviews are tracked at `submission/prompt-log/reviews/`, not `reviews/`. Run a backtick-path existence check before handoff. Unit count: `git archive HEAD` into scratch, symlink `.venv`, pytest (about 6 min), save under `artifacts/unit-count-<sha>.txt`; a count is valid only for its commit. Library recall: committed `evals/reports/library-latest.md` (a74b727) gives entries 0.775, amounts 0.681, flags 0.81; the PM reviewer's d0b04bc run (untracked evidence) gave amounts 0.580 — flag the mismatch, don't pick silently. Never present T-181/T-179 as built until committed.

**Pitfalls:** pandoc needs a blank line before bullet/numbered lists after a bold lead-in; table column widths follow the dash counts in the separator row; a nested `**` inside a blockquote broke the miss-story block. The git-guard refuses `git add && git commit` in one command: stage, then commit with a pathspec in a second call.

**Number sources (re-check before final, they move):** live ship bar `evals/reports/20261102T164038Z.md`; unit 5698 / e2e 412 `evals/reports/m3-sensors.md`; library 34/42 = 0.81 from `reviews/GATE-M3-product-manager.md` (committed `library-latest.md` was stale); billing rounds `reviews/T-140-claims-adjuster*.md`; verify_quickly 4 `reviews/GATE-M3-paralegal.md` (old screen, persona, not a real paralegal).

**Honesty rules held:** no Chris-past facts beyond Appendix B; thresholds in Part 2 (30% time, 60% adoption) are labeled "my starting numbers"; fixes still in flight (T-177, T-179, T-181 guided UI) worded as in progress, so refresh them when those cards close.
