description: Bash hooks that block reviewer commands in this repo (board.py --help, python -c containing backticks) and the workarounds
metadata:
  type: reference

- board-guard: reviewers may run only `tools/board.py validate|show|list|status`. `--help` is rejected.
- git-guard fails to parse `python3 -c "..."` when the code contains escaped backticks. Use a quoted heredoc (`python3 - <<'EOF'`) and build the fence as '`'*3.
- Write access is limited to reviews/ and artifacts/review-evidence/ (plus this memory dir). Probe scripts go in artifacts/review-evidence/.

**How to apply:** use these forms directly to avoid wasted tool calls. Related: [[golden-set-recurring-findings]]
